This is an very basic project that shows how flask mail module is used to send mail. The user-name and the password are saved as an environmet variables and is being accessed using the OS module.
It is not necessary to store the the your(senders) usernsame and password as an environment variable but it is a better option for your own privacy.
The time module is only used to calculate the time in seconds (time is in foat, to get the real time convert it into structured time).
